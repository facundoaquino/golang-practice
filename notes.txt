- When you’re writing code that will live in its own
package, it’s good practice to name the package the same as the folder the code is in.
All the Go tooling expects this convention, so it’s a good practice to follow.


- It’s a convention in Go to give factory functions the name of New. This New function does something
interesting: it creates a value of the unexported type and returns that value back
to the caller.
