- When you’re writing code that will live in its own
package, it’s good practice to name the package the same as the folder the code is in.
All the Go tooling expects this convention, so it’s a good practice to follow.


- It’s a convention in Go to give factory functions the name of New. This New function does something
interesting: it creates a value of the unexported type and returns that value back
to the caller.         


*****CONCURRENCIA****

-The Go runtime scheduler is a sophisticated piece of software that manages all
the goroutines that are created and need processor time.

-When two or more goroutines have unsynchronized access to a shared resource and
attempt to read and write to that resource at the same time, you have what’s called a
race condition. Race conditions are the reason concurrent programming is complicated
and has a greater potential for bugs. Read and write operations against a
shared resource

go build -race

-Unbuffered channels provide a guarantee between an exchange of data. Buffered
channels do not.
